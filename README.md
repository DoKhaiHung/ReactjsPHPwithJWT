# Getting Started with Create React App Integrating JWT in PHP API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### BACKEND
Use composer to manage your dependencies and download PHP-JWT:
### `composer require firebase/php-jwt`
### `composer require paragonie/sodium_compat`
note: JWT::decode now just acceptes an instance of key.
